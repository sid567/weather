# Global weather app

Introduction:
The Global Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to get current weather information for any city and country in the world. Users can enter a city and country name, and the app will display the weather details, including location, temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed.

# Features
1.User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use input fields for city and country names.

2.Weather Information:

Location (City and Country)

Temperature (in Celsius)

Weather Condition (e.g., Clear, Rainy)

Humidity (in percentage)

Wind Speed (in km/h)

3.Real-Time Weather Data: Fetches live weather details using the Weatherstack API.

4.Error Handling: Alerts the user if an invalid city or country is entered or if there is a problem with the API.

# How it works

The user inputs a city and country name into the provided fields.

Upon submission, the JavaScript code sends a request to the Weatherstack API with the input values.

The API responds with the current weather information.

The application extracts relevant data from the API response and displays it to the user.
